# The-Battle-of-Neighborhoods-k-mean-clustering

The average American moves about eleven times in their lifetime. This brings us to the
question: Do people move until they find a place to settle down where they truly feel happy,
or do our wants and needs change over time, prompting us to eventually leave a town we
once called home for a new area that will bring us satisfaction? Or, do we too often move to
a new area without knowing exactly what weâ€™re getting into, forcing us to turn tail and run at
the first sign of discomfort?
# Problem
The crime statistics dataset of London found on Kaggle has crimes in each Boroughs of
London from 2008 to 2016. The year 2016 being the latest we will be considering the data
of that year which is actually old information as of now. The crime rates in each borough
may have changed over time.
This project aims to select the safest borough in London based on the total crimes, explore
the neighborhoods of that borough to find the 10 most common venues in each
neighborhood and finally cluster the neighborhoods using k-mean clustering.
